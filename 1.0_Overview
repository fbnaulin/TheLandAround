# 1.0 Overview

The Land Around is a roleplaying game set in the southern Mapuche territory during the Spanish conquest. It covers the time period from 1598 to 1656, from Mass mapuche rebellion to the transformation of frontier relationships.

At those times, Mapuche society lived between navigable rivers, among vast landscapes. They grouped in big families, governed by the father, and mixed with neighboring kins, with whom shared stories and knowledge.

Players take on the role of skilled envoys, assisting leaders in critical tasks, as they traverse harsh terrain. Their capacities evolve along the paths of the warrior, wisdom, and nature.

The game revolves around: fluid and visceral skirmishes, changing political panorama, and resource collection for crafting and trade.
