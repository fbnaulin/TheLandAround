# 1.0 Overview

The Land Around is a roleplaying game set in the southern Mapuche territory during the Spanish conquestâ€”an era of shifting alliances and fierce rebellion, where tradition clashes with emerging innovation, and each journey leads to uncertain paths.

Players take on the role of skilled envoys, serving powerful leaders and assisting them in critical tasks, as they traverse dangerous lands. Versatile in their abilities, they evolve along the paths of the warrior, wisdom, and nature.

The game revolves around three main matters: fluid and visceral skirmishes, political influence, and resource collection for crafting and trade.
